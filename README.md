Convert Kiro accounts to OpenAI / Anthropic compatible API service.

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md) | [Tiếng Việt](README_VI.md)

If this project helps you, a Star would mean a lot.

## Features

- Anthropic `/v1/messages`, OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` & OpenAI `/v1/responses`
- Multi-account pool with round-robin load balancing
- Auto token refresh, SSE streaming, Web admin panel
- Multiple auth: AWS Builder ID, IAM Identity Center (Enterprise SSO), Microsoft Enterprise SSO, SSO Token, local cache, credentials JSON, Kiro API Key
- Usage tracking, account import/export, i18n (CN / EN / VI)
- Support configuring outbound proxy (SOCKS5 / HTTP)

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quorinex/Kiro-Go.git
cd Kiro-Go
mkdir -p data
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name kiro-go \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/quorinex/kiro-go:latest
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quorinex/Kiro-Go.git
cd Kiro-Go
go build -o kiro-go .
./kiro-go
```

### Deploy on Zeabur

The repo already includes a `Dockerfile`, so it builds and runs on Zeabur out of the box.

**Option 1: Dashboard (one-click)**

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account.
2. In Zeabur, create a new service and choose **Deploy from GitHub**, then select your fork.
3. Zeabur auto-detects the `Dockerfile` and builds the image.
4. In the **Networking** tab, expose port `8080` and bind a domain.
5. In the **Variables** tab, set at least `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (admin panel password).
6. Mount a Volume at `/app/data` if you want accounts / config to survive redeploys.

**Option 2: CLI**

```bash
npm i -g zeabur
zeabur auth login
zeabur deploy
```

> Run the commands from the project root. The CLI writes `.zeabur/context.json` to remember the target project / service — it contains personal IDs, so don't commit it.

Once the service is up, open `https://<your-domain>/admin` to log in.

Config is auto-created at `data/config.json`. Mount `/app/data` for persistence. The default admin password is `changeme` — override it via the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var or change it in the admin panel before going to production.

## Usage

Open `http://localhost:8080/admin`, log in, add accounts, then call the API:

```bash
# Claude
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4.5","max_tokens":1024,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

# OpenAI
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer any" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

### Add a Kiro API Key account

In the admin panel, choose **API Key** when adding an account and paste `ksk_...` (or `ksk_...|region`).

You can also import via the credentials API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/api/auth/credentials \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: <admin-session>" \
  -d '{"kiroApiKey":"ksk_your_key|us-east-1","authMethod":"api_key","nickname":"cli-key"}'
```

API Key accounts call the Kiro CLI runtime (`https://runtime.{region}.kiro.dev/`) with `tokentype: API_KEY`. They skip OAuth refresh and do not use `profileArn`.

## Thinking Mode

For Claude models, the model-name suffix (default `-thinking`) is the switch: `claude-opus-4.6-thinking` sends native `thinking.type: adaptive`, `thinking.display: summarized`, and `output_config.effort: high`; the same name without the suffix explicitly sends `thinking.type: disabled`. Client-side `thinking` settings do not override this rule. No thinking prompt is injected. Upstream reasoning content is forwarded even if it unexpectedly arrives for a plain model or the client requests `display: omitted`. Chat Completions and Claude output formats remain configurable under Settings - Thinking Mode; Responses uses reasoning summary items and streaming events. Claude-specific request parameters are not added to other model families.

Opus 5.5 is an exception because its upstream rejects disabled thinking: without the configured suffix it uses native `adaptive + low`; with the suffix it uses `adaptive + high`. Returned reasoning remains visible in both modes.

If an account returns an empty generation stream (no text, reasoning, or complete tool call), that account is excluded from the affected model for 60 seconds by default. Settings → **Cooldowns & Statistics** lets you set this duration to 1–604800 whole seconds and the maximum credential attempts to 1–100 (default: 7, including the initial attempt). A successful attempt stops retries; admin tests only use the selected account. More attempts can increase waiting time when upstream failures persist. Settings persist across restarts. Previously saved minute-based durations are converted to seconds; configurations without a saved duration use 60 seconds. Duration changes apply to newly triggered model cooldowns; existing deadlines and other account cooldown rules are unchanged. Retry limits are read once per failover sequence from in-memory settings. Other models on that account remain available. Plain and thinking variants share the same model cooldown; account fallback and admin test calls cannot bypass it. Account cards show cooling models and their remaining time, and refresh after admin tests. Cooldowns expire automatically and are persisted by the existing batched save (normally within three seconds), so saved cooldowns survive restarts.

Settings → **Reset Cooldowns** clears all account/model cooldowns and consecutive-error penalties immediately, including saved cooldowns. Usage statistics, disabled accounts, and quota eligibility are unchanged. New failures can start a new cooldown.

## Outbound Proxy

For users in restricted network regions, configure an outbound proxy in the admin panel under **Settings - Outbound Proxy Settings**. Supports SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies.

The setting takes effect immediately without restarting.

Model generation requests have a 15-minute total timeout per upstream attempt, covering connection, thinking, and response output. This applies to streaming and non-streaming requests through both global and per-account proxies. Authentication and metadata requests keep their separate short timeouts; downstream clients and other relays may impose shorter limits.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Config file path | `data/config.json` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin panel password (overrides config) | - |

## Contributing

Friendly discussion is welcome. If you run into issues, try asking Claude Code, Codex, or similar tools for help first — most problems can be solved that way. PRs are even better.
